- What primitives does base.frg 
- add signatures (cross check if it is there)
- add hashes ()
- no key cycles
- adding pairs
- adding timestamps


- RECENT TODO
- documentationf or transcriber, for changes to base.frg
- encrypted terma=s matching only when inverse key is known
- run file constraints uses sensible defaults, and some json file like interface for giving constraints
- visualizer updates

- visualizer not handling encypted terms correctly have to fix


- report should be ready by april 29 30 by latest official 28th


- FOR LATER
- what the predicates for a trace based property and equivalence basedd property,
- bettter interface/language for stating additional predicates


- IMP NOTE
- The only thing ensuring that attacker can't generate the same nonces as the other agents is 
  a uniq-orig statement, can probably add separate constraint which says a nonce can never be genrated agian
  transcription for skeleton blocks of code is complete, still have to do proper checks
- consider if want to add code for transcribing skeleton to transcribe.py, currently only in 
  transcribe_seq.py
