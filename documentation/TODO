- What primitives does base.frg
- add signatures (cross check if it is there)
- add hashes ()
- no key cycles
- adding pairs
- adding timestamps
* TODO Extend tool with signature and hashes
* TODO fix the problem with encryption related terms
* TODO implementing timestamps
* TODO check documentation is up to date and correct
* TODO text should be able to contain multiple terms
Example in otway rees protocol symmetric key K_ab has to be confusable
with the sequence of terms M,A,B.
For the other protocol example sent in teams need something similar
To fix these below TODOs
** TODO implement 'bytes' datatype containing sequence of messages
*** TODO possibly update visualizer to make this work
*** TODO enc. term when key not known is arbitrary bytes
* TODO Final goal
 * model a protocol with singatures hashing and encryption
 * state correspondence property (example mutual authentication)
 * maybe state correspondence property using a template
* TODO maybe change to give constraint using a json file
* TODO just like added test for parser add manual tests for running the file
*** TODO see if can get output of forge run in command line to run automated tests

* TODO figure out what trace and equivalence based predicates would look like
** TODO maybe better interface for stating predicates as well?
 * The only thing ensuring that attacker can't generate the same nonces as the
   other agents is a uniq-orig statement, can probably add separate constraint
   which says a nonce can never be genrated agian transcription for skeleton
   blocks of code is complete, still have to do proper checks (seems to be
   working with two_nonce.rkt have to check in more detail later)
 * consider if want to add code for transcribing skeleton to transcribe.py,
   currently code for that only in transcribe_seq.py
 * added code for checking if strand knows the encryption key, have to check
   this more (two nonce working, have to check if will give arbitrary ciphertext
   when key is not known)
 * While sending message to recognise ciphertext don't need to know inverse key,
   need to know while receiving add this later
